            <p>Codemate is specialized in developing web-based services and mobile applications according to the visions of our clients. We are the development partner for efficient and flexible software creation.

                Codemate guys and girls are hardcore software professionals, being able to handle complex back-end systems and the latest front-end technologies. In addition to developing web services with mainly open source technologies, we have built a strong mobile
                application development team during the past years. Knowing the both worlds, web and mobile, has helped us greatly in delivering complete digital solutions for our clients. We have carried out hundreds of development projects for small businesses and large corporations. Whether you are looking for a new user interface, a responsive web service or a mobile application, we'll tailor a solution that matches your needs.

                What makes Codemate special is the ability to integrate our development and support teams as part of the customer's own organization. Combined with the project management expertise, we can provide true development scalability and cost-efficiency to our customers. The development process is based on agile SCRUM principles.

                Our work atmosphere is relaxed and fun, yet the tasks are challenging enough to keep us learning all the time. We are not back-office nerds, but coders deal with the customers too. We really like what we do and that shows in our work.</p>
